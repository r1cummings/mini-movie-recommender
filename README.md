## Notes: :exclamation:
- To see the full list of movies that can be passed into the script go to [my Kaggle](www.kaggle.com/dataset/ff6c55df9a4bd7d8d0d48c8da0171d1ed10ecbe1a489a2f949bb68903479052e) or check out the movie_names csv in the data folder.
- Be sure to include the year of the movie because there are movies that have been remade recently.
- All data is in the data folder but full credit goes to movielens.org and these are REAL movie reviews.
